# Doodle Jump - Aavegotchi-style
* Built with love for the [Aavegotchi](https://aavegotchi.com) Universe.
* Leverages [SES](https:/github.com/endo/endo/packages/SES) in order to mitigate security issues within the JavaScript codebase -> This ensures fair-play amongst users, etc, by enforcing the Principle of Least Authoity (POLA).

## Todo
* [] identify areas of game code that:
  * are non-deterministic
  * can be abstracted into generalized functions.
* [] Assess need for [Lavamoat](github.com/Lavamoat)
* [] Integrate ability to operate game via mobile device movements
